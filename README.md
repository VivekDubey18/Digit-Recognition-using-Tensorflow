## 🖥️Digit Recognition using Tensorflow

This project implements a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** in TensorFlow/Keras to classify handwritten digits (0–9) from the **MNIST dataset**.  
The model is trained with **callbacks** for better optimization and overfitting prevention, and the results are visualized with accuracy plots.

## 🚀 Training Details
- **Optimizer**: Adam  
- **Loss Function**: Categorical Crossentropy  
- **Batch Size**: 32  
- **Epochs**: 8 (with Early Stopping to stop overfitting and save best model)  
- **Validation Split**: 10%  

---

## 📌 Callbacks Used
- **ModelCheckpoint** → Saves the best model based on validation accuracy.  
- **EarlyStopping** → Stops training if validation loss doesn't improve for 3 consecutive epochs.
